Abstract Class and Interface:
Create an abstract class Animal with an abstract method makeSound(). Then create subclasses Dog and Cat which implement makeSound() method.
Interfaces with Static and Default Methods: Create an interface Calculator with static and default methods for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Implement this interface in a class BasicCalculator.
Using Swing Components to demonstrate inheritance: Create a GUI application where you extend Swing components (e.g., JFrame, JPanel) to create a custom UI with inheritance.
